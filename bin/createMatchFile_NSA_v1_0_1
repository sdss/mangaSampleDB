By definition, mangaids with catalogid=1 are simply the index of the target
in the NSA v1_0_1 catalogue. As such, this matching is especially simple.
For each mangaid, the corresponging target in NSA v1_0_1 is retrieved by
splitting the mangaid string. I.e., mangaid=1-123456 corresponds to the target
in NSA v1_0_1 with index 123456. The unique NSA target is defined by its NSAID.
Note that this correspondance is ONLY VALID FOR NSA v1_0_1. Subsequent
versions of the NSA catalogue will requiere matching with v1_0_1 before
matching with mangaids.

    By definition, mangaids with catalogid=1 are simply the index of the target
    in the NSA v1_0_1 catalogue. As such, this function is especially simple.
    Note that this correspondance is ONLY VALID FOR NSA v1_0_1. Subsequent

    Parameters
    ----------
    nsaCat : str
        The path to the NSA v1_0_1 catalogue.
    mangaTargetsExt : str
        The path to the MaNGA_targets_extNSA catalogue.

    Returns
    -------
        Produces two files. The first one, `nsa_v1_0_1_matched.fits`, contains
        two columns, the first being `mangaid` and the second the matching
        `nsaid`. The second file, `nsa_v1_0_1_matched.txt`, is a plain text
        file with the explanation (very simple, in this case) of how the match
        was done.
